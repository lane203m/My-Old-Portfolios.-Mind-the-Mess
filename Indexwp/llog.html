          <tr>
            <td width="886" height="218" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" ><p align="center">I learned how to make efficeint use of the bone tool. The bone tool is used to make animation quicker. It does this by doing exactly as its name suggests - it creates a &quot;bone&quot; on the objects, or attaches two objects together via a bone. The object then can move or bend according to the position and limitations set on the bone.</p>
            <p align="center"> I also learnt how to make animated buttons. These buttons, rather than leading to links, began an animation only seen when the buttons were clicked. First, you need to use the programing language in flash. This language allows you to tell animations to only play when a certain event occurs. For example, clicking on an image queues an animation. I found the language, action script, very annoying. </p>
            <p align="center">The last thing I was taught involved even more complex use of action script, use of video in the animation, audio, and a great trick for lip syncing (lining audio up with an animated mouth to create the illusion that it came from the character). The first bit, action script, was all about complex buttons. I was tauht how to make a button animate a video into my project. I was then shown the most valuable trick in flash pro. For every year I've done animation, I always ran into a problem, the sound. First, I could not start or stop the sound at any point in the animation. I could only do that on the beginning and end. So, if I pressed play and pause 4 times, I would have four versions of my audio playing at once until they came to an end. It was unbearable. This also meant that lip syncing was impossible. To lips sync an animation, you need to stop and start the audio/animation at certain points in order to change the position of a characters mouth. Because I couldnt stop the audio and it always began at the beginning, lip syncing was a chore. One of the lessons I learnt added a great piece of advice: In the audio files property menu within Flash Pro, change the sync options to steam and the one below it to repeat. This allows the user to scrub the timeline of the animation and hear the audio at any point on any frame, as well as beginning and ending the aduio at will. The last thing I was taught was making a video flash friendly. You actually need another program for this called adobe media encoder. In the encoder, you chose the video file you need and simply let the encoder do the rest of the work. It is then Flash Pro friendly.</p>
            <p align="center">I learnt all of this from Adobe's classroom in a book.</p></td>

            <td width="886" height="416" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p align="center">This was never part of any lessions, but I learnt it as a bi product of animating. In an animation, the characters aprearance and movement is an important part when creating life-like animations. As of this year, I still haven't gotten their body movement down, my characters are still robots so to speak. However, I did learn what will become my standard art style when creating SHADED characters and models. First, I learnt what programs some of the best of the best use. Many use Manga Studio, AKA Clip Studio Paint. Exploring this new program was like my first days in flash, or photoshop. I learned that this program had a wide range of brushes that could be customized to fit all sorts of rolls. I also learnt about a life-saving feature I have not yet seen in photoshop or illustrator. Manga Studio has a setting for every layer you work on (Like photoshop, manga studio has layers in order to overlap images, etc). This setting allows you in a sence, lock a layer to its colored parts only. In other words, your brush will only affect the parts that have color on them, instead of the blank transparent areas. This setting allows you to nicely shade along the edges quickly, without needing carefull hands. A tool similar to this is photoshop's color replacement tool, which only changes the parts of the layer that are not blank. However, photoshop's tool does a poor job, as it more or less overlaps and mixes the colors, rather than replacing them. Manga Studio is also a lot more friendly than illustrator. In my opinion, Illustrator would be used for astounding life-like art, while Manga Studio would be suited for a more cartoon like approach, anime perhaps. I also learnt that Manga Studio will save me from the pain of paying $15 dollars a month for Illustrator, since Manga Studio is only a one time payment.</p>
            <p align="center">I also learnt how to use an animators pad, which is a tool used by artists in order to draw digital art with a pencil (stencil), not an innacurate mouse. Unlike a pencil, you can draw on the pad as you would on paper, allowing for better lines, etc. You can also effect the radius and strength of the lines you draw by pressing harder or lighter on the tablet with the stencil - just like a pencil would on paper.</p>
            <p align="center">I learnt how to use manga studio from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/OneyNG">youtube animator</a> and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn27rfC1BK8">14 minute lesson</a> on realistic backgrounds. I then used the art style of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzNejayDmQI">Battlefield Friends</a> in order to create my own <a href="Animation/harper model.png">models</a> and <a href="Animation/parliament base.png">backgrounds</a>, which all looked realitively nice.</p></td>

         </tr>
          <tr>
            <td width="886" height="546" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p align="center">Unlike last year, I learnt how to make music in mixcraft that used edited audio files in order to create a completely different mood/sound. I learnt how to take the default audio provided and adjust different characteristics of the sound. This could create a variety of different effects. It could make a violin sound like an electric guitar, a piano sound like static, etc, etc. The options were limitless. </p>
              <p align="center">Next we focussed on remixing, what a remix was, etc. A remix, by the way, is when someone takes another&rsquo;s work of art and adds to it or changes it into something nearly unrecognizable. I created two remixes, a video remix and an audio remix. In an audio remix, the idea was that you would replace or move certain parts of a sound file with other, custom sounds, in order to create something new. I didn't like this project. I felt like I was gutting a song, and as a newbie to remixing, was making it worse. Video remixes did the same as the first one, only you also had to allign the audio with the video. Beats had to match up with changes in the video, etc. If you did this with a dance video, every beat would need to line up with the movement of the dance (clapping their hands, tapping their toes, etc).</p>
              <p align="center">The last audio project involved stations, teaching us the different kinds of tools used in making beats in the real world (Being a DJ). First, we were shown the boss loop station rc505. With it, you select a sound file in the machine, or make your own by recording your voice, etc and then make it loop with the machine. For example, you sneeze. That sneeze is now constantly looping. From there you can change the volume, speed, length, pitch, etc, in order to create a cool repeating sound. Then you add more loops, making an even better beat. All this is made on the spot and becomes an amazing display.</p>
              <p align="center">We then learnt how to use the traktor kontrol s2. This was a small DJ table that allowed us to mess around with audio. We could use the tools on it to change the pitch, speed, volume, flanger, eq and range, just like we were taught digitally in the first lesson. It could also be used just like a DJ table and its record player in order to jump from points in the audio immediately or create a scratch sound. </p>
              <p align="center">Finally the AKAI mpc1000. This was a device with pre loaded sound files. for each of the buttons pressed played a unique sound file. Each press could be looped and used to make a beat, it was similar to the boss loop station rc 505</p>

            <td width="886" height="269" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p align="center">This was more of a review of last years work. However I learned how to make better use of masks and other effects that create the illusion of desintegration. I was taught how to make objects morph or jiggle, slowly dissapear as an animated mask ate up the images. An animated mask as I call it, was a layer that controlled something that it was made the &quot;parent of&quot;. The &quot;parent&quot; layer could be used to give the layer it controlled certain attributes. This meant that you could make the &quot;child&quot; layer disapear. The child layer would look like is dissapeared as a line panned from left to right, while the &quot;parent&quot; would trun from white to black as it panned along. That being said, the &quot;parents&quot; were always hidden as we only wanted them to control somthing else, but not appear in the final video. </p>
            <p align="center">Video copilot also taught me how to make spheres, which is just a simple effect you drag on the object you want. Along with that, I was shown how to make images glow with effects, making magma, etc. I even learnt how to make something explode, by using an effect. Everything else was more or less review from previous years.</p>
            <p align="center">I also learnt how to make fog and a starry night.</p></td>

I was shown how to make things round, or add more edges, how to make custom shapes, organic or edgy. I was shown how to duplicate one half of an object, like a face, and flip it in order to create the other side. I was also shown how to organize the items in the project and their heirarchys. The tutorials also showed me some of the options and effects you can add in order to create diffrent kinds of shapes.
