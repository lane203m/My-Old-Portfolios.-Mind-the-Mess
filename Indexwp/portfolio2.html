This Project intended to once again improve and or finalize my cartoon art style. The idea was that this project would become the template for future animations and their appearance. I began this project first by painting a rough draft, and then finally converting it into a nice digital copy. The digital version is far superior. After finishing this assignment, I have finally come to the conlcusion that Clip Sudio Paint is a much better program for creating cartoon artwork, and would highly reccomend it in replacement of Illustrator and the painting aspect of flash professional. It is a fantastic program and is easy to work with after a single lesson. The brush types are also more friendly and innovative. All in all, Clip Studio Paint, AKA Manga Studio, is perfect for creating life-like art. It's cheaper too.</td>

It is one thing to copy a lesson, its another to make it with your own flair. I needed to prove that I could use after effects by meself, with little help or inspiration. The result was this - a project that merged three lessons together in order to create somthing new, a video remix of the sort. making the two lessons &quot;Blue planet&quot; and &quot;Dead Planet&quot; morph into one another was easy, the hard part was making Earth desintegrate into the Dead Planet. I ended up using a lesson that intended to desintegrate a person or grenade from left to right. Tweaking this lesson for my own use, I managed to create something that desintegrated from the inside out. It was therefore a much longer project, but the results were very satisfying.</td>

Then, in order to go even further, created my own custom sound effects for the desintegration and ambiend magma. I did this by editing the eq, flanger, range, phase, etc of the sound in mixcraft; I used a recording of a volcanic eruption and sizzling bacon as the origional files.

This piece was my last attempt to prove to myself that I had leart from the four years of lessons, and could make my OWN work, without the help of cookie-cutter lessons. I needed to know that I could make things by myself and did not need lessons to create good quality work. Obviously I still have a lot to learn, but the projects I made this year were very reasuring. They showed me that I will indeed leave Communications Media able to make things with the same quality as I was taught, without needing them to hold my hand for every step. I use no lessons to create this photoshop, it is the culmination of everything I have leart before hand. All I used was inspiration from these two photo - montage masters. These guys are who I tried to emulate in my image. They took everyday landscapes and objects, and made them into post apocalyptic wastelands, surreal volcanos, mountain ranges, lakes and more! I wanted to create a battlefield out of nothing, and I did. </p></td>
